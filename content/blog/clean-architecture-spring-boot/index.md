# Implementing Clean Architecture in Spring Boot Applications

Clean Architecture is a software design philosophy that emphasizes separation of concerns and dependency rules. In this post, we'll explore how to implement Clean Architecture in a Spring Boot application.

## What is Clean Architecture? 🤔

Clean Architecture, introduced by Robert C. Martin, consists of concentric circles representing different layers of the application:

## Project Structure 📁

Here's how we can organize our Spring Boot project following Clean Architecture principles:

```java
com.example.cleanarch/
├── domain/
│   ├── entity/
│   │   └── User.java
│   └── repository/
│       └── UserRepository.java
├── usecase/
│   └── UserService.java
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── persistence/
│   │   └── JpaUserRepository.java
│   └── web/
│       └── UserController.java
└── application/
    └── CleanArchApplication.java
```

## Code Examples 💻

Here's a simple example of how the layers interact:

### Domain Entity

```java
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private String username;
    private String email;

    // Getters, setters, and business logic
}
```

### Use Case / Service Layer

```java
@Service
@Transactional
public class UserService {
    private final UserRepository userRepository;

    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    public User createUser(String username, String email) {
        User user = new User(username, email);
        return userRepository.save(user);
    }
}
```

## Benefits of Clean Architecture ✨

1. **Independence of Frameworks** - The business logic doesn't depend on the existence of any framework
2. **Testability** - The business rules can be tested without UI, database, or any external elements
3. **Independence of UI** - The UI can change without changing the rest of the system
4. **Independence of Database** - Your business rules aren't bound to the database

## Code Quality Metrics 📊

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Test Coverage | 65% | 89% |
| Cyclomatic Complexity | 15 | 8 |
| Dependencies | 12 | 6 |

## Conclusion

Clean Architecture helps us create applications that are:
- Testable ✅
- Independent of frameworks ✅
- Independent of UI ✅
- Independent of databases ✅

Remember to always focus on the business rules and keep the dependencies pointing inward! 🎯
